At your home I will wear a mask, and if requested I will put on gloves as well. Safety first!\n\nI grew up around my grandfather who was a \"jack of all trades\" and we did a lot of work on things around our house and those of my family. I am currently a fully self-employed handyman--this is what I do full time, 8 to 12 hrs, every day. I can guarantee you I will know what needs to be done with your tasks. \n\nBefore my current job, I was in the U.S. Navy and also worked in the maritime industry (cargo ships) so I am good at improvising, being resourceful, dependable, and honest. \n\nI've worked in New Orleans for awhile, where there are a lot of older homes, so I know how to recognize rare or unique craftsmanship and antique fixtures, and how to be delicate. My main skills include carpentry, painting, concrete, sheetrock, stucco, among various others for which a need may arise as part of living in a home. For example, in one day I built IKEA furniture, patched drywall holes, diagnosed a faulty garbage  disposal, painted a wall, and framed up a floor in a shed. \n\nI promise that I can help you with whatever you may need done, and if I can't, I will be upfront, let you know, and explain why.",

At your home I will wear a mask, and if requested I will put on gloves as well. Safety first!\n\nI grew up around my grandfather who was a \"jack of all trades\" and we did a lot of work on things around our house and those of my family. I am currently a fully self-employed handyman--this is what I do full time, 8 to 12 hrs, every day. I can guarantee you I will know what needs to be done with your tasks. \n\nBefore my current job, I was in the U.S. Navy and also worked in the maritime industry (cargo ships) so I am good at improvising, being resourceful, dependable, and honest. \n\nI've worked in New Orleans for awhile, where there are a lot of older homes, so I know how to recognize rare or unique craftsmanship and antique fixtures, and how to be delicate. My main skills include carpentry, painting, concrete, sheetrock, stucco, among various others for which a need may arise as part of living in a home. For example, in one day I built IKEA furniture, patched drywall holes, diagnosed a faulty garbage  disposal, painted a wall, and framed up a floor in a shed. \n\nI promise that I can help you with whatever you may need done, and if I can't, I will be upfront, let you know, and explain why.",
