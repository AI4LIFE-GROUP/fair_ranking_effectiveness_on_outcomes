    The purpose of this study is to evaluate human decision making with the help of a ranking algorithm. The
    experiment will consist of a short series of instructions on what we would like you to evaluate, and the
    participation in tasks related to the choice of gig workers for a one time job.
    <p/>
    In total, your participation in this experiment will take about 5 minutes. You must be at least 18 years of age
    to participate. Your participation in any part of this study is voluntary. You have the right to refuse to
    participate, or withdraw from the study at any time without any repercussions. There are no known risks
    associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life.
    <p/>
    As a research participant, you will receive compensation. If you complete the study, you will receive compensation
    of $0.70 .
    You can earn additional compensation of up to $0.15 based on your performance in the study.
    The study will consist of 3 comprehension questions followed by 3 tasks regarding the hiring of gig workers
    and a brief survey of 6 questions about your decision making process and your perception of the algorithm.
    <p/>
    Confidentiality of the research records will be strictly maintained. The data will be collected on a secure
    server. The output of the study will be based on an aggregation of data collected from multiple informants.
